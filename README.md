#Running the game

There is a way to make it into a .exe but it's a hassle to do it during developement. Just download LOVE2D, make a desktop shortcut for the executable, and drag the 'source' folder onto the icon to run it. We'll make the executables at the end, when we're ready to distribute the game.
